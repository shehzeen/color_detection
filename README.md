# color_detection

The program allows you to calculate mean and covariance of desired classes in training images. 

Step 1: 
The first program to run is the PythonTraining.py program which creates the text File with mean and covariance of any number of classes necessary. It generates a text File called Output_Mean_Cov.text. 

Please change the directory inside this file by changing the varPath variable.

varPath ='...'
os.chdir(varPath)
