# color_detection

The program allows you to calculate mean and covariance of desired classes in training images. 

Step 1: 
The first program to run is the PythonTraining.py program which creates the text File with mean and covariance of three classes (this can be extended to more number of classes). It generates a text File called Output_Mean_Cov.text. 

Please change the directory inside this file by changing the varPath variable.

varPath ='...'
os.chdir(varPath)
